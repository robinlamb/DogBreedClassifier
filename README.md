# Dog Breed Classifier

This is a project for my Udacity Deep Learning program.  It is an image classifier that will determine if an image is of a person or a dog, and will return the closest breed of dog that the input image resembles.  The VGG16 convolutional neural network is used to determine if a dog is present in the image.  OpenCV is used for face detection to determine if a face is present.  The breed is determined from a transfer learning network made from the VGG16 network.
